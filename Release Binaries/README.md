Goomba Save Manager
===================

This directory contains the executable files for the console and GUI versions of goombasav.

If you want to distribute these files elsewhere, please include COPYING.txt (a copy of the GNU General Public License, v3) and the README.md file from the main directory.

goombasav_gtk.exe is a Windows build of the GTK+ (2.0) frontend. It requires the GTK+ libraries (http://www.gtk.org/download/win32.php) to run, but I'm not certain exactly which DLLs are necessary.
