Goomba Save Manager
===================

This directory contains the executable files for the console and GUI versions of goombasav. The GUI version (goombasav_cs.exe) requires the DLL (goombasav_net.dll) to run, so make sure to grab both files.

If you want to distribute these files elsewhere, you must include COPYING.txt (a copy of the GNU General Public License, v3). You should also include the README.md file from the main directory.

goombasav_gtk.exe is a Windows build of the GTK+ (2.0) frontend. It requires the GTK+ libraries (http://www.gtk.org/download/win32.php) to run, but I'm not certain exactly which DLLs are necessary.
